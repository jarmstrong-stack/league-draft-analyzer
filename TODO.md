# Code neural net
Needs to preload game data and load champ mapping
Also needs to instanciate its own Normalize class.
needs to handle new games(without synergy calc, because Normalize doesnt do it)

# Make a "meta-proof" model
Find a way to make this model to be meta-proof in a way.

Maybe will need to re-train the model periodically with the latest games and give it some sort of priority?

## Make utlity "search" functions for processed data
Make utility functions to search data in processed data(search teams like T1 or champs like Yone), calculate win-rate, etc..

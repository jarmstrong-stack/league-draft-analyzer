# Build a normalization system for neural net
Make it so its very easy to change what data we are inputting
and make it normalize automatically by just changing what we input

Maybe will need to make functions and call getattr() to do this dinamically

# Make a "meta-proof" model
Find a way to make this model to be meta-proof in a way.

Maybe will need to re-train the model periodically with the latest games and give it some sort of priority?

## Make utlity "search" functions for processed data
Make utility functions to search data in processed data(search teams like T1 or champs like Yone), calculate win-rate, etc..
